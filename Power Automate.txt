Power Automate is a low-code platform - UI code
	Creates Workflows between apps & services
	Streamlines repetitive tasks
	Automate Through Outlook, Teams, Sharepoint

Events that trigger -> Power Automate Workflows

Cloud Flows (Main one) - cloud data sources & services, pre built connectors
Desktop Flows - Device based, local data sources & applications, desktop automation

Connectors
	Standard - Teams, Sharepoint, Outlook, X, LinkedIn
	Premium(require additional licence) - Adobe, Deepl, SQL Server

Menu
	Enviroments, Testing/Production e.t.c. - Top Right cornet
	Approvals
	Solutions - All components built
	Process mining - A analysing existing flows
	Connections - 

Connectors have actions

Test - To test the flow, ex send email to trigger flow and test

Types of flows
	Automated cloud flow - Flow triggers based on cloud actions inside apps
	Instant cloud flow - Manual, for selected file, Powerapp/BI click, for selected message teams
	Scheduled cloud flow - Every other minute, week e.t.c.

Triggers & Actions
	Triggers
		Manual
			Can add text, boolean, file, email, number, date parameters input fields (can make nullable)
		Powerapps (Similar to Manual)
			Can add text, boolean, file, email, number, date parameters input fields (can make nullable)
		MS Form - When a new response is submitted
		When an item is created
			Site adress
			List/table name
			Check based on interval
		Make each Trigger change It's own flow run per item instead of all of them then a bunch of for loops
			Settings -> Split on -> Array trigger output -> on the trigger
			So all changes are triggered one by one (Drag out n delete for each loop) So each change is an individual flow run!

	Action (search, ex planner) - You can utilize fields for more internal actions! Again all json under the hood
		Normal
			Compose - Like an alert/console.log equivalent, Good dummy & expression action
			Delay
		Planner
			Create a task
			Update a task Details
		Sharepoint
			Send an HTTP request to Sharepoint
			Create Item - Can map from previous import action
			Get Items (ex Employees table)
			Update Item (status, or similar based on id)
			Get changes for item or file -> Trigger window start token
			Get Item
			Get File Content using path
		Outlook
			Send an email (V2)
		Teams
			Post message in a chat or channel
		Excel Online
			List rows present in a table - ex onedrive, in settings pagination threshold
			Add a row into a table
				Sometimes cannot select - Select table by name
				Row {"Month": "", "Units Sold": 400} e.t.c..
		MS Forms
			Get Response Details
		Office 365 Users
			Get my profile
			Get manager - User Upn = email
		Onedrive
			Create File
			Convert File - Convert to pdf
				Remove the "" on filecontent - To fix error
			Delete File
				Locked File - Do Until isnot equal to Outputs = 423 + Delay 20 seconds
		Create CSV Table - Requires array
			Use Custom key + value
			Paired with Create File
		Create HTML Table - 
			Can add a compose to give some styling css <style> then select compose output into html body
			Paired with Send an email
		Filter Array - Great for having advanced Filtering options however need entire table first
			Good to not make to many api calls
			ex 
			@or(
				equals(
					item()?['OfficeLocation']?['Value'],
					'Zurich'
				),
				equals(
					item()?['OfficeLocation']?['Value'],
					'Paris'
				),
				equals(
					toLower(item()?['Skills']), - Checks every item
					'relation'
				)
			)
		Select & join - extract specific properties from an array or object / Concatinates variables
			, - ex seperates with comma
			Can select by key ex First Name = item()?['firstName'] 
			Textmode takes json -> same item()?['firstName'] now prints Name
			can also do in json select ex -> Concat(item()?['firstName'], ' ', item()?['lastName'])
		Parse JSON
			Parsing JSON into a valid power automate object with fields.
			Can use sample payload to generate
			You can add "title" to the json object if same name and nested, to differentiate them

	Lighting Logo
		Enter data from a previous step
		Every Action/Trigger can have multible fields/returns
			ex Email would have, From, To Subject

Different Branches & modifiers
	+ Add Parallel branch -> have two branches run & split into different actions/tasks ex onboarding customers, create sharepoint site, welcome email three branches all at once.

	Modifiers
		Apply to each - Apply something to specific group
		Foreach Loop/Apply to each - Ex when get items, foreach is run sequentially
			settings -> parallelism -> Turns on Async Mode. But can be a problem with concurrency
			SPEED: settings -> parallelism -> Turns on Async Mode Up to 50 -> To make flow much much faster
		Condition - If/else
			AND/OR
			Ex Department is equal to finance 
			False no actions, true compose (log) people
			Add Group - ex equal to group IT OR Finance AND skills contains & office location is ...
			contains, is equal to 
		Do untill - While loop -> until condition is met
		Scope - Groups flow
		Switch - Like a switch with cases
		Terminate - Terminates flow and set statuscode/status
	Scope - Groups together a bunch of actions, ex SCOPE HR, SCOPE MANAGER.

Expressions fx - Always part of an action
	Typically you would use a compose for expressions
	Numbers
		add(x,y)
		mul() - Mutliply
		rand(min,max) - Random number
	Strings
		concat(triggerBody()?['text'], '-', utcNow()]) - Turns inputs into string
		replace(text, 'oldText', 'newtext')
		Retrieve link from string
			indexOf(text, 'https') - Gets startindex of "https"
			sub(length(compose initial sentence), start https value), 
			substring(compose initial sentence, start https, lengthofurl)
	Dates
		utcNow()
		dateDifference(Startdate, endDate triggerbodies...)
		formatDateTime(date, 'yyyy/MM/01') - Formats Date value into certaint format
			'MMMM, yyyy' - February 2024
	Arrays
		first(arr) - Selects first item of array

	Conversion
		int(*)
	Length() - Same as .length
	union()

Debugging & Error Handling
	click run -> Now you can check all inputs/outputs
	Error handling - run after
		On action -> Settings -> Run After -> Has ex failed
	You can this way do a branch split and run first if previous failed vs succeeded
		Ex Terminate action 

Variables
	variable action - int, float, string, boolean 
		Initialize variable - ex varCount
		Increment variable - Add to variable
		Set variable - Set variable to ex get item order quantity
		examples 
			varEmails(string - ) FX Mail column, condition before Office location value = zurich
			Remember to reset booleans ex in a for loop
	arrays - Can contain, objects, ints, strings (You are basically just working in json inside power automate)
	object - JSON Object 
		{
			"title" :
			"genre" :
		}
		Get key
			@{items('for_each_object')?['ID']} - Gets the ID from the object
			@{items('for_each_object')?['Author']?['Email']} - Gets the email and author from the object

OData (Open Data Protocol) - standardized protocol used for building and consuming RESTful APIs
	Great for selecting from the api (Sharepoint table for example.) Instead of foreach loops for filtering! 

	Querying: You can filter, sort, select, and paginate data using query parameters (e.g., $filter, $orderby, $top, $skip).

	Select
		_api/Items?$Select=Title,population - Selecting different fields based on orderparameter
	Sort
		_api/Items?$orderby=population desc - 
	Filter
		_api/getbytitle('Cities')/Items?$filter=population lt 300000 - Less than 300000
		_api/getbytitle('Cities')/Items?$filter=stateName eq 'California' - 
	Combine with &
		?$filter=population It 300000
		&$filter=stateName eq 'California'
		&$select=Title,population,stateName
		&$orderby=population desc
	Filter Operators - In power automate it does have these things built in to the filtering
		Lt - less than
		Le - less than or equal
		Gt - Greater than
		Ge - Greater than or equal
		Eq - Equal
		Ne - Not Equal

		startsWith - 
		substringof - Contain certain character in the specific column
		Eq - Equal
		Ne - Not Equal
		day(), month(), year(), hour(), minute(), second() - Convert Date string to
			'yyyy/MM/01' - Greater than the 1st of the month
	Pagination
		On get items request - Settings -> Networking, Pagination threshold
