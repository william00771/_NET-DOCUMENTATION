Hashset works like dictionary, except its just keys pretty much
new string() == new string() - Comparison works here

contains duplicate
	create hashset
	if n is in hashset return true
	else add it to the hashset

valid anagram
	sort str1 and str2
	compare str1 and str2 as new string

	check that length of both str are the same, false if not
