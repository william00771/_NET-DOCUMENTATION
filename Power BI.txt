Data analysis is about creating relationships between tables
Conditional Columns - Create category
	One-To-One - One matching to one matching
	Many-To-One - More than one record from primary table to one matching in secondary
	One-To-Many - Opposite of Many-To-One
	Many-To-Many - Many from Primary table to many from secondary table.

KEY - Understand Your Data!
Backend - Data operations (Crucial) to get data visualization look good!
importing data
	get Data -> sql server database -> select tables you want -> 
Normal Edit mode
	Dropdown arrow - Remove ex blank/null data. ex lat, long geographic places
Table edit mode
	right click -> Edit Query
	Basic Operations
		Data type - Converting data type -> Select column and datatype -> change (this casts values)
		(you can also duplicate column and do cast if you want to make whole number to category		

	Create conditional columns (categorizing tables, ex rooms, pay, gender based on if statement (flags))
		Add column -> cond column -> ex paycategory -> Add enums based on conditionals
			High, Low, Medium
			You can populate scale aswell, so ex is less than becomes low(0-2) High(5+) Otherwise Medium (3-4)
			Add for gender -> based on name Female/Male -> otherwise Male -> 2nd conditional column
		Custom Column based on expression
			In relationship -> Edit Queries
			Ex profit target = ([Revenue]*55)/100 - Creates a new custom column

	Create custom tables
		Home -> Enter Data -> Create a year, change - looking at Historic Pay Data for example Two tables

applied steps
	like fusion 360 history
Good steps
	Filter out null values
	Close & apply (obviously)
Table Relationships
	Press Relationship Icon
	Press down on ex ShopId-ShopId table1 to table2 just like with prop pointers in c#

		

Frontend - Where you create your visuals, dashboard
	Headers(123)
		Field ex pay and filter gender table by male
		average instead of sum ex - in field dropdown menu
	Charts
		Settings
			Axis - X Axis
			Value - Y Axis
			Legend - Splits chart into multible colors based on Category Flag
		Visuals
			Legend
			Title
			Data labels - 
		Dropdown, new quick measure
			Allows you to do a calculation ex Percentage difference, Sum of profit to Sum of revenue
		Modifying The calcultions
			Select the quick measure you created -> three dots -> more options -> code window pops up
			QuickMeasureName = 
				var NAME = sum('TABLE selection')
				RETURN
					if(
						Ex NOT ISBLANK(_Revenue)
						DIVIDE(_Profit, _Revenue)
					)
	Available in all charts
		Dropdown - Ex average instead of sum (the little arrow)
		Filters - Ex select only males from table of males/females or similar specific data
		Legend - What to split by (Category)
		Color control - FX: Ex Gradient format style based on lowers -> highest value for example

	Different types of charts used
		OBS - You can add deeper levels into each value/legend - ex gender and then name deeper layer
		OBS - Remember if you have blanks in your data you have to filter that out in all charts!
		
		Clustered Column Chart - Basic Column chart up y axis
		Donut Chart - Splits donut into colors representing different categories
			Value - What value to represent
			Legend - What to split by (Category)
		Clustered Bar Chart - Like Column but instead left to right
		Waterfall Chart - Displays Change Over Time or similar (difference based on ex time)
		Slicer - Aka Filter!
		Filter - select type, they filter based on that table(it becomes the category)
			There is a slider aswell, so you can check range of ex rooms
		Table
			Add a clickable table just like the table view but user can click on it and you specify columns to display
		Card - Can apply filters to the actual header itself, 
			We can get different values ex male pay

		Map - Displays bubbles on a map based on certain characteristics
			lat, long fields
			Check for blank entries!
		Tree Map - Parking Space map
			Boxes take up space, ex category car almost like pie chart but parking space like
		Stacked Area Chart - 
		Gauge Chart (value) - Whether a revenue goal was met (meter)
			Value, the profit ex
			Max Value - What we are comparing to, aka revenue 
			Target Value - profit targer
		Gauge Chart (percentage)
	Analysis
		Draw Conclusions from the data findings

I should do everything to UNDESTAND THE DATA. What are the different properties in their massive databsase and what can we get out of it!
