Data analysis is about creating relationships between tables
Conditional Columns - Create category
	One-To-One - One matching to one matching
	Many-To-One - More than one record from primary table to one matching in secondary
	One-To-Many - Opposite of Many-To-One
	Many-To-Many - Many from Primary table to many from secondary table.

KEY - Understand Your Data!
Backend - Data operations (Crucial) to get data visualization look good!
	importing data
		get Data -> sql server database -> select tables you want -> 
	data operations
		converting data types
			Select column and datatype -> change (this casts values)
			you can also duplicate column and do cast if you want to make whole number to category
	create conditional columns (categorizing tables, ex rooms, pay, gender)
		Add column -> cond column -> ex paycategory -> Add enums based on conditionals, hilowmedium pay
		Add for gender -> based on name Female/Male -> otherwise Male -> 2nd conditional column
		You can populate scale aswell, so ex is less than becomes low(0-2) High(5+) Otherwise Medium (3-4)
		Custom Column based on expression
			In relationship -> Edit Queries
			Ex profit target = ([Revenue]*55)/100 - Creates a new custom column
	creating tables (very uncommon)
		Home -> Enter Data -> Create a year, change - looking at Historic Pay Data for example Two tables
	applied steps
		like fusion 360 history
	Good steps
		Filter out null values
		Close & apply (obviously)
	Table Relationships
		Press Relationship Icon
		Press down on ex ShopId-ShopId table1 to table2 just like with prop pointers in c#

		

Frontend - Where you create your visuals, dashboard
	Headers(123)
		Field ex pay and filter gender table by male
		average instead of sum ex - in field dropdown menu
	Charts
		Settings
			Legend - Which Category
			Axis - X Axis
			Value - Y Axis / pie chart
		Visuals
			Legend
			Title
			Data labels - 
		Dropdown, new quick measure
			Allows you to do a calculation ex Percentage difference, Sum of profit to Sum of revenue
		Modifying The calcultions
			Select the quick measure you created -> three dots -> more options -> code window pops up
			QuickMeasureName = 
				var NAME = sum('TABLE selection')
				RETURN
					if(
						Ex NOT ISBLANK(_Revenue)
						DIVIDE(_Profit, _Revenue)
					)
	Filters
		Filter btn - select type, they filter based on that table(it becomes the category)
			There is a slider aswell, so you can check range of ex rooms
		Table
			Select what values you want from sql table
	Different types of charts used
		Clustered Column Chart
		Donut Chart
		Clustered Bar Chart - Good for layered data -> Drawdown feature
		Waterfall Chart
		Table
		Card
		Slicer
		Map
			lat, long fields, Check for blank entries!
			Bubbles, bigger/smaller
			Colors based on ex final price
		Tree Map
			Boxes take up space, ex category car almost like pie chart but parking space like
		Stack Area Chart
		Gauge Chart (value) - Whether a revenue goal was met (meter)
			Value, the profit ex
			Max Value - What we are comparing to, aka revenue 
			Target Value - profit targer
		Gauge Chart (percentage)
	Analysis
		Draw Conclusions from the data findings

I should do everything to UNDESTAND THE DATA. What are the different properties in their massive databsase and what can we get out of it!
