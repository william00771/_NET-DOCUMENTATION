.NET______________________________________________________________________

What is the difference between an an abstract class and class?
	An abstract class cannot be instanciated directly. It's commonly used as inheritance by other classes.

What is the difference between a class and a sealed class?
	A sealed class cannot be inherited. It is used to prevent extension of a class, good for security

What is a struct?
	Structs are value types stored on the stack, more performant. No inheritance. Good for light data.

What are access modifiers?
	They define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods and other members.

What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
	Both are contracts that a class implements, Abstract class can provide abstract methods. but only be inherited once. abstract if you want shared functionality and interfaces if you want to define a pure contract.

Explain the Dispose pattern in C# and how it differs from finalizers.
	It's used to release unmanaged resources when they are no longer needed. Finalizers are a form of auto dispose

What the dependency injection pattern?
	It's used to achieve inversion of control between classes and dependencies. a form of import for dependencies.

What are extension methods?
	They allow you to add new methods/utility to existing types without modifying their source code.

What are key differences between value and reference types?
	Value Types int/struct are stored in (fast)stack, while classes, IEnumerable are stored in the (slow)heap

What are streams and what does it mean to leave an open stream?
	Streams are abstractions used to read from or write to data sources. open means not disposed/closed

What is the difference between string and StringBuilder?
	string is immutable while the stringbuilder is mutable

What is the difference between readonly and const in C#?
	const is a (fixed)pre-compile value whereas readonly is a run-time value so it can vary between instances.

What is a hash function and how does GetHashCode() work in C#?
	a hash function maps data to a hash value. Gethashcode is used to generate hash for objects. Equals returns it.

How does the HashSet<T> differ from a List<T> or Dictionary<TKey, TValue> in C#?
	HashSet<T> is a collection that stores unique values. It does not allow duplicates and only stores keys.

What is the relationship between Equals(), GetHashCode(), and Contains() in hash-based collections like HashSet or Dictionary?
	In hash based collections GetHashCode() returns (bucket)hash, equals verifies truly equal. Contains is 2in1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?
	Authentication deals with credentials and authorization deals with permissions.

What are the different DI Container service lifecycles in .NET?
	Transient: new instance each time service requested, Scoped: creates a new instance per request, Singleton: single instance during entire application lifetime.

What is the purpose of IServiceScopeFactory.CreateScope() in .NET?
	It's a way to manually create a new scope when an automatic scope(httprequest) doesnt exist.

What is the purpose of the using statement in .NET?
	It ensures unmanaged resources such as file streams, database connections e.t.c. are properly disposed of when they go out of scope.

What is the difference between using IHostedService and BackgroundService in .NET?
	They are both background services. IHostedService gives you more control over the lifecycle with methods like stopasync, startasync and access to a cancellationToken while BackgroundService is simpler with only ExecuteAsync.

How does IHttpClientFactory help manage HttpClient instances in .NET Core?
	Without factory the underlying sockets remain open. HttpClientFactory uses connection pooling. It also centralizes configuration and lifetime management. It uses HttpMessageHandlers under the hood and periodically refreshes them.

What is middleware in ASP.NET Core and how does it work in the request pipeline?
	Middleware is the software layer within the hosted application that forms the backbone of the request pipeline. They run sequentially.

Explain how caching works in ASP.NET Core and the different types of caching available.
	Caching is used to store data temporarily to improve performance and reduce load. In-Memory (data & obj in server memory), Distributed Caching (multible servers redis, sql), Response Caching (cache httpresponse for similar request).

What is the purpose of IOptions<T> in .NET Core and how is it typically used?
	IOptions<T> is used to manage configuration settings from a strongly typed class.

What are asynchronous streams in C# and when would you use them?
	IAsyncEnumerable<T> allow for asynchronous iteration over collections of data. Ex fetching where data arrives over time.

Explain the difference between HttpContext and IHttpContextAccessor in ASP.NET Core.
	HttpContext represents the current HTTP request/response context. The IHttpContextAccessor gives context access outside the standard request pipeline meaning outside of the controller or middleware.

How does Model Binding work in ASP.NET Core?
	It converts incoming request data into .NET Objects. From FormData, query strings, route-data e.t.c.

Explain the IQueryable interface and how it differs from IEnumerable.
	IEnumerable uses in-memory data processing while IQueryable allows for deferred execution. It represents a query that can be excecuted against a data source. It's not run until you enumerate it .ToList() .First().

Explain the Factory Pattern and its purpose in C#.
	It Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class. We rely on abstraction instead of concrete types.

What is the Mediator Pattern and when would you use it in .NET?
	Centralizes communication between components preventing them from communicating directly. It uses a central hub acting as the fascilitator.

What is the difference between ref and out parameters in C#?
	reference must be initialized before it is passed to the method wheras out does not. But instead must be assigned a
	value.

How does the Null-conditional (?.) operator work in C#?
	If the object is null, it returns null instead of throwing a NullReferenceException

What are expression-bodied members in C#?
	They provide a more concise way to write methods or property accessors using the => lambda syntax
	.
What is the await keyword and how does it differ from Task.Wait()?
	await is used to asynchronously wait for a task to complete without blocking the current thread, while Task.Wait()
	blocks the current thread until the task is complete. 

What is the difference between throw and throw ex in exception handling?
	throw rethrows the original exception, preserving the original stack trace. throw ex resets it.


Explain lazy loading and how to implement it in C#.
	Lazy loading delays the initialization of an object until it is needed. In C#, this can be achieved using the Lazy<T>
	class, which ensures that the object is only created when first accessed.

What are Tuple and ValueTuple in C#, and how do they differ?
	Tuple is a reference type used to group multiple values. ValueTuple is newer and more efficient performance wise.

How would you implement thread safety in a C# application?
	using synchronization mechanisms like lock, Monitor, Mutex, Semaphore, or ReaderWriterLockSlim. Other options include 
	using concurrent collections (ConcurrentDictionary, BlockingCollection, etc.) or Interlocked for atomic operations.

What is a Func<T>, Action<T>, and Predicate<T> in C#?
	Func<T> is a delegate that returns a value. Action<T> is a delegate that doesn't return any value but can take
	parameters. Predicate<T> is a delegate that takes one input and returns a bool, typically used for filtering.

Explain how you would handle cross-cutting concerns like logging and exception handling in .NET applications.
	Cross-cutting concerns can be handled using middleware, filters, dependency injection or aspect-oriented programming. 
	Where the Aspects handle the concerns



What is LINQ and what are the advantages of using it?
	It's a query language that simplifies data querying. It has a declarative syntax making it more readable.

What is Delegate in C#, and how does it differ from Event?
	A delegate is a type-safe function pointer that allows methods to be passed as parameters. An event is a special kind 
	of delegate that provides notifications.

What is the difference between virtual and internal methods or fields in C#?
	Virtual can be overridden by derived classes, customizing behavior. Internal is accessable only within that assembly.

What is an event handler in .NET?
	They are delegates used to handle events.

What is the difference between IEnumerable, IQueryable, and IList in C#?
	IEnumerable & IQueryable have deferred excecution. So they excecute when you enumerate them. IQueryable is typically 
	used for database queries. IList provides random access to elements by index which the others do not.

What is IClassFixture in xUnit, and when would you use it?
	IClassFixture<T> is an interface in xUnit that allows test context sharing across multiple test methods within the same 
	test class.

What does shared context mean in .NET testing, and how is it used?
	Using the same dependencies and states across multible test methods through IClassFixture, ICollectionFixture.

What is the Observer pattern in .NET?
	The Observer pattern is a design pattern where an object (the subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) 
	and notifies them of any state changes




.SQL______________________________________________________________________
What is SQL?
	tructured Query Language is used to communicate with databases, allowing users to CRUD Data.

What are the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?

What are the ACID properties in a database?
	Atomicity (all or nothing, if one part fails the entire transaction is rolled back), 
	Consistency (Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another), Isolation (Ensures that transactions are executed independently of each other), and 
	Durability, (Once a transaction committed, it remains in disk even in the case of a failure).

What are Indexes in SQL?
	They create a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval for queries on a particular column or set of columns

What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes?
	clustered index is created, the data is automatically restructured and sorted while with non-clustered index, the data itself is not restructured; instead, a separate structure is created to reference the data.
