Overriding the ToString inside a class
	public override string ToString()
	{
		return $"{nameof(x)}: {x}"....
	}

Factory Method - Instead of one big constructor with enums describing type & switch determining assignment.
	This means you can't actually show the user you need to specifically give a comment to the user that describes what to do and how to initialize the constructor. So instead just create it around what the user wants.
	Factory Example
		public class Point
		{
			public static Point NewCartesianPoint(double x, double y)
			{
				return new Point(x, y);
			}
			public static Point NewPolarPoint(double rho, double theta)
			{
				return new Point(rho*Math.Cos(theta), rho*Math.sin(theta));
			}

			private double x, y;

			private Point(double x, double y)
			{
				this.x = x;
				this.y = y;
			}
		}

		var Point = point.NewPolarPoint(1.0, Math.PI / 2)) - To call one of the factory methods
